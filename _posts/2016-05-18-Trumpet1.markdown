Yesterday was a great day, I had a concert, where I played in the school Jazz band, and also the Concert Band.
The concert went really well, I had two solos, and everyone says I did great on both.
But, I think the best part of yesterday is that I found out that I made the High School Jazz band, and the Concert band. 
I was super nervous since my audition didn't go to great, but now I am anxios to start playing with a great band next school year.
